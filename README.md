# Railway-System-Management
**The system will manage information about trains, including the train name, number of coaches, train type, and current journey status. This will form a pool of trains that can be selected for scheduling new journeys. A schedule table will record the train schedules, detailing the start time, end time, source, destination, and route taken by the train.

The system will store data on passengers who have traveled, are traveling, or will travel in the future. This includes their basic information, the train they are traveling on, coach number, berth number, ticket status, and their respective schedules.

Additionally, the system will maintain a list of station names, providing details about each station, including its name and the city or state it is located in.

Lastly, a route information table will specify the routes that trains will take between source and destination stations.**
